I received my bachelor's degree from Southeast University in Nanjing, China, and will move to Nanjing University for graduate study.

Currently, I work on offline rendering topics related to light transport simulation, including specular light transport, path guiding, and differentiable rendering.

In my personal life, I'm a big fan of music (both classical and pop, mainly piano or vocal). Also, I love films, photography, animations, and workout.
