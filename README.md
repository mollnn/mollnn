I am now pursuing a bachelor's degree at Southeast University in Nanjing, China, and will move to Nanjing University for graduate study, where I have begun my journey with computer graphics, specifically physically-based rendering. 

I work on **offline** rendering topics related to light paths **gradients**, in particular **specular** light transport and **differentiable** rendering.

In my personal life, I'm a big fan of music (both classical and pop, mainly piano or vocal). Also, I love films, photography, animations, and workout.
